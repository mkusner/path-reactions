  abstract = "Machine learning (ML) and quantum mechanical (QM) methods can be
              used in two-way synergy to build chemical reaction expert
              systems. The proposed ML approach identifies electron sources and
              sinks among reactants and then ranks all source-sink pairs. This
              addresses a bottleneck of QM calculations by providing a
              prioritized list of mechanistic reaction steps. QM modeling can
              then be used to compute the transition states and activation
              energies of the top-ranked reactions, providing additional or
              improved examples of ranked source-sink pairs. Retraining the ML
              model closes the loop, producing more accurate predictions from a
              larger training set. The approach is demonstrated in detail using
              a small set of organic radical reactions.",
