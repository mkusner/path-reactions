\subsection{Results}
We now give the results of our model on the problems of \emph{Reaction Product Prediction} and \emph{Reaction Mechanism Prediction}. For product prediction we compare with the state-of-the-art graph-based method \cite{jin2017predicting}. We also trained a Seq2Seq baseline model according to the work of \cite{schwaller2017found}. Unfortunately, with the hyperparameter settings described in the paper we were not able to reproduce their results. As the authors have not released their code or a trained model, we omit this baseline.
