In this section, we begin with a chemistry background on molecules and chemical reactions. We then describe related work in machine learning on predicting chemical reactions. We then describe a particularly important subclass of chemical reactions, called \emph{linear electron flow (LEF)} reactions. Finally, we describe the contributions of this work.



\subsection{Molecules and Chemical reactions.}
Organic (carbon-based) molecules can be represented via a graph structure, where each node is an atom and each edge is a covalent bond (see example molecules in Figure~\ref{fig:task-overview}).
Each edge (bond) represents two electrons that are shared between the atoms that the bond connects. 

Electrons are particularly important for describing how molecules react with other molecules to produce new ones. All chemical reactions involve the stepwise movement of electrons along the atoms in a set of reactant molecules. 
This movement causes the formation and breaking of chemical bonds that changes the reactants into a new set of product molecules \citep{herges1994coarctate}. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:task-overview} (\emph{Right}) shows how electron movement can break bonds (red arrows) and make new bonds (green arrows) to produce a new set of product molecules.

\subsection{Related work}
In general, work in machine learning on reaction prediction can be divided into two categories: 1. \emph{Product prediction}: where the goal is to predict the reaction products, given a set of reactants and reagents, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:task-overview} (\emph{Left}). However, for this task we do not care {\em how} the reactants react. 1. \emph{Mechanism prediction}: where the goal is to determine {\em how} the reactants react, i.e., the movement of electrons, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:task-overview} (\emph{Right}).


\paragraph{Product prediction.}
% wei2016neural
The earliest work we are aware of that uses deep learning to predict the products of reactions is \cite{wei2016neural}. Their idea was to approximate the operations of a molecular fingerprint so that all operations become continuously differentiable. They then learned parameters of this fingerprint to accurately predict product fingerprints end-to-end.
% coley2017prediction
% TODO
% jin2017predicting
Another graph-based technique is \cite{jin2017predicting} who construct a network based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm for testing graph isomorphism. They use this algorithm to select atoms that will be involved in a reaction. They then enumerate all chemically-valid bond changes involving these atoms and learn a separate network to rank the resulting potential products. This method is state-of-the-art on product prediction.

% schwaller2017found
\cite{schwaller2017found} represents reactants as SMILES (CITE) strings and then used a sequence to sequence network (specifically, the work of (CITE)) to predict product SMILES. While this method is end-to-end trainable the SMILES representation is quite brittle as often single character changes will not correspond to a valid molecule.

\paragraph{Mechanism prediction.}
The only other work we are aware of to use machine learning to predict reaction mechanisms are \cite{fooshee2018deep,kayala2012reactionpredictor,NIPS2011_4356,kayala2011learning}.
All of these model a chemical reaction as an interaction between atoms which function as electron donors and those which function as electron acceptors. They predict the reaction mechanism via two independent models: one that identifies these likely electron sources and sinks, and another that ranks all combinations of them.
However, this combining and then ranking of electron sources and sinks can be a slow process, as many plausible reactions need to be considered (the number of subgraphs of $n$ reacting atoms, where single bonds are either added or removed is $2^{n(n-1)/2}$).
These models also have only so far been successfully trained on small hand-curated datasets.

As a whole, this related work points to at least three main desirable characteristics for reaction prediction models: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{End-to-End}: There are many complex chemical constraints that limit the space of all possible reactions. How can we differentiate through a model subject to these constraints?
\item \emph{Graph-Based}: Recent successes in deep learning models for graphs can embed similar graphs to similar vectors. How can we use such models to predict graphs?
\item \emph{Mechanistic}: Learning the mechanism offers a number of benefits over learning the products directly including: interpretability, sparsity, and generalization.
\end{enumerate}

%In general, a model that predicts the reaction mechanism has a number of benefits over predicting the product of reaction directly: (a) \textbf{interpretability}: If the model makes a mistake, it is easy to see where, and possibly why, it goes wrong by comparing the steps of the mechanism with the correct steps. (b) \textbf{sparse}: Reactions often only affect between 3 and 7 atoms out of anywhere from 10-50 reactant atoms. Modeling the reaction as a path allows one to exploit this sparsity. (c) \textbf{chemically constrained}: Learning a path allows one to easily incorporate chemical constraints, such as the alternating removal and addition of bonds, among others. (d) \textbf{generalizable}: As reaction paths follow similar trends in different molecules, mechanistic models naturally generalize to unseen molecules.

Table~\ref{table.existing} describes how the current work on reaction prediction satisfies these characteristics. In this work we propose to model a subset of reactions with \emph{linear electron flow} (LEF), described below.

\subsection{Linear Electron Flow reactions} 
%
Reaction mechanisms can be classified by the topology of their ``electron-pushing arrows'' (the red and green arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:task-overview}). Here, the class of reactions with \emph{linear electron flow} (LEF) topology is by far the most important, followed by those with cyclic topology \citep{herges1994coarctate}. In this work, we will only consider LEF reactions that are \emph{heterolytic}, i.e., they involve pairs of electrons.

If reactions fall into this class, then a chemical reaction can be modeled as pairs of electrons moving in a \emph{single path} through the reactant atoms. 
Further, this electron path will alternately remove existing bonds in molecules, and form new ones. We show this alternating structure in Figure \ref{fig:task-overview} (\emph{Right}). 
The reaction formally starts by (step 1) taking the pair of electrons between the Li and C atoms and moving them to the C atom; this is a remove bond step. 
Next (step 2) a bond is added when electrons are moved from the C atom in reactant 1 to a C atom in reactant 2.
Then (step 3) a pair of electrons are removed between the C and O atoms and moved to the O atom, giving rise to the products. 
Predicting the final product is thus a byproduct of predicting this series of electron steps.


\paragraph{Contributions.} We propose a novel generative model for modeling the reaction mechanism of LEF reactions. Our contributions are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose an end-to-end generative model for predicting reaction mechanisms, \ourModelR, that is fully differentiable. It can modularly be used with any deep model on graphs.
\item We design a technique to identify LEF reactions and their underlying mechanism from purely atom-mapped reactants and products.
\item We demonstrate that our generative model learns chemical trends such as functional group selectivity.
\end{itemize}
