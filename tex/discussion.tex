In this paper we proposed \ourModel, a model for predicting electron paths for reactions with linear electron flow.
These electron paths, or {\em reaction mechanisms}, describe how molecules react together. 
Our model (i) produces output that is easy for chemists to interpret, and (ii) exploits the sparsity and compositionality involved in chemical reactions.
As a byproduct of predicting reaction mechanisms we are also able to perform reaction product prediction,
comparing favorably to the strongest baselines on this task. 
 %Work to extend the model towards all classes of chemical reactions is currently ongoing and will be reported in due course.
