In this paper we proposed \ourModel, a model for predicting electron paths for reactions with linear electron flow.
These electron paths, or {\em reaction mechanisms} provide a detailed description of how molecules react together. 
Our model (i) produces output that is easy for chemists to interpret, and (ii) is able to exploit the sparsity and compositionality involved in chemical reactions, in which often only small numbers of atoms in the reactants interact.
As a byproduct of predicting reaction mechanisms we are also able to perform reaction product prediction,
 and achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task. 
 Work to extend the model towards all classes of chemical reactions is currently ongoing and will be reported in due course.
