In this paper we proposed \ourModel, a model for predicting electron paths.
These electron paths, or {\em reaction mechanisms} provide a detailed description of how two reactants react together. 
Our model, (1) produces output that is easy for chemists to interpret and (2) is able to exploit the sparsity involved in chemical reactions, in which often only small numbers of atoms in the reactants interact.
As a byproduct of predicting reaction mechanisms we are also able to perform reaction product prediction,
 and achieve state of the art performance on this task.
